#   # Email regex used to validate email formats. It simply asserts that
  # an one (and only one) @ exists in the given string. This is mainly
  # to give user feedback and not to assert the e-mail validity.

  # Regexp
 #
 #  A Regexp holds a regular expression, used to match a pattern against strings. Regexps are created using the /.../ and %r{...} literals, and by the Regexp::new constructor.
 #
 #  Regular expressions (regexps) are patterns which describe the contents of a string. Theyâ€™re used for testing whether a string contains a given pattern, or extracting the portions that match. They are created with the /pat/ and %r{pat} literals or the Regexp.new constructor.
 #
 #  A regexp is usually delimited with forward slashes (/).

VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\-\d]+(\.[a-z]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i
# \\ declares a regular expression pattern
# \A[\w+\-.]+ = the username part of the email address
# /A = matches beginning of string
# [/w+/-.] = matches any number of words (\/w+\), - character(\/-\), or any single character 1 or more times besides a new line (\.\)
# + after [\w+\-.] means that whatever is matched inside must be matched 1 or more times.
# @ = @ symbol of the email address to declare username@domain.domainextension
# [a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i = the domain name
# [a-z\d\-]+ = any letter a-z ([a-z]), digit character (\/d\), or - character (\/-\) any number of times (+). This is the domain name without the domain extension (ayosinformatics in doug@ayosinformatics.com)
# (\.[a-z]+)* = () capture what's inside. \. is a period character followed by any letter any number of times([a-z]+), the whole capture must occur at least 0 times
# \. is a period character
# [a-z]+ is any letter character 1 or more times.
# \. is a period character
# [a-z]+ is any letter character 1 or more times.
#  \z matches the end of the string (meaning this has to be the last part of the email address)
# i after a /.../ regex means to ignore case. We use this because emails aren't case sensitive.
